    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course. In this notebook, you'll learn some techniques for evaluating the output of a language model. As part of the evaluation, you will also use Gemini's structured data capability to produce evaluation results as instances of Python types.\n",

    "Note: This notebook is more code-heavy than the first Day 1 notebook ([Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/)). This notebook is not a prerequisite for days 2 and beyond, so feel free to skip over it, or come back later in the week. If you have not yet tried the [Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/) notebook, start there first as it introduces the fundamentals for interacting with LLMs.\n",

       "\n",
       "*   **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer:** Gemini 1.5 Pro is based on a sparse MoE Transformer architecture. This allows the model to have a large number of parameters while only activating a subset for any given input.\n",

       "**3. Infrastructure:**\n",

It uses a MoE Transformer architecture and undergoes pre-training, instruction tuning, and human preference tuning. The training process incorporates improvements across the model stack to enable long-context understanding and overall performance."

       "1.  **Lots of Examples:** First, you show the puppy lots and lots of things. You show it pictures of cats, dogs, cars, and houses. You also read it stories and tell it about all sorts of things. The computer brain also gets to see and read lots of things – millions and millions of pictures, books, and websites!\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Learning Patterns:** The puppy starts to notice patterns. It learns that things with pointy ears and a tail are often dogs, and that when you say \"sit,\" it should put its bottom on the ground. The computer brain also learns patterns. It learns that certain words often go together, and that certain pictures are related to certain words.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Making Predictions:** Now, you ask the puppy a question, like \"Where's the ball?\" The puppy tries to guess where the ball is based on what it has learned. The computer brain also tries to guess the answer to questions.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Getting Feedback:** If the puppy guesses right, you give it a treat and say \"Good job!\" If it guesses wrong, you gently correct it. The computer brain also gets feedback. If it guesses right, it gets a little reward. If it guesses wrong, it adjusts itself to try to guess better next time.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Repeating and Improving:** You keep showing the puppy things, asking questions, and giving feedback over and over again. The puppy gets better and better at understanding and responding to you. The computer brain also keeps learning and improving. It gets better at understanding and answering questions, and even at doing new things that it wasn't specifically taught!\n",
       "\n",
       "So, training a big computer brain is like teaching a puppy, but with lots and lots of examples, and instead of treats, the computer brain gets little rewards that help it learn and improve. And just like a well-trained puppy, a well-trained computer brain can be very helpful and do amazing things!\n",

       "*   **Advanced Intelligence:** The Gemini program was a NASA space program that achieved many firsts in space exploration. Naming the model \"Gemini\" could be a way to associate it with innovation, exploration, and advanced capabilities.\n",
       "*   **Google's Naming Conventions:** Google often uses names that are evocative and related to the project's goals. \"Gemini\" fits this pattern, as it suggests duality, advanced capabilities, and exploration.\n",

    "## Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "### LLM limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n",
    "\n",
