    "\n",
    "### What Problem Does Memory Bank Solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your deployed agent has **session memory** - it remembers the conversation while you're chatting. But once the session ends, it forgets everything. Each new conversation starts from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- User tells agent \"I prefer Celsius\" today\n",
    "- Tomorrow, user asks about weather → Agent gives Fahrenheit (forgot preference)\n",
    "- User has to repeat preferences every time\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 What is Vertex AI Memory Bank?\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Bank gives your agent **long-term memory across sessions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Session Memory | Memory Bank |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------|\n",
    "| Single conversation | All conversations |\n",
    "| Forgets when session ends | Remembers permanently |\n",
    "| \"What did I just say?\" | \"What's my favorite city?\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **During conversations** - Agent uses memory tools to search past facts\n",
    "2. **After conversations** - Agent Engine extracts key information (\"User prefers Celsius\")\n",
    "3. **Next session** - Agent automatically recalls and uses that information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Session 1:** User: \"I prefer Celsius\"\n",
    "- **Session 2 (days later):** User: \"Weather in Tokyo?\" → Agent responds in Celsius automatically ✨\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Memory Bank & Your Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Agent Engine deployment **provides the infrastructure** for Memory Bank, but it's not enabled by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To use Memory Bank:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add memory tools to your agent code (`PreloadMemoryTool`)\n",
    "2. Add a callback to save conversations to Memory Bank\n",
    "3. Redeploy your agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Once configured, Memory Bank works automatically - no additional infrastructure needed!\n",
