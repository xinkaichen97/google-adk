Imagine a software development process where tasks are intelligently handled by specialized units working in perfect harmony. This isn't science fiction; it's the reality of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and they are poised to revolutionize how we build software.\n\n**Breaking Down Complexity with Decentralized Intelligence**\n\nMAS empower you to decompose complex problems into smaller, manageable agents. Each agent is designed to perform a specific function, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code. This modularity inherently enhances resilience; if one agent encounters an issue, others can often compensate, preventing catastrophic system-wide failures. Think of it as a highly adaptable team where each member can seamlessly pick up slack. Furthermore, this decentralized structure offers incredible scalability and flexibility, allowing you to easily add or remove agents to adapt to changing requirements or increased workloads, fostering more agile development and deployment.\n\n**Boosting Efficiency Through Parallel Processing and Automation**\n\nThe efficiency gains from MAS are substantial. Agents can operate independently and execute tasks concurrently, drastically reducing both development and execution times for complex operations. MAS also introduce intelligent automation. Agents can be programmed with sophisticated decision-making capabilities, automating routine tasks, proactive error detection, and even providing intelligent suggestions to developers. Beyond task automation, agents can intelligently manage and allocate resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth based on real-time needs, leading to demonstrably more efficient system performance.\n\n**Fostering Innovation and Smarter Software**\n\nPerhaps the most exciting aspect of MAS is their potential for fostering innovation. The dynamic interaction between multiple agents can lead to emergent behaviors and uncover novel solutions that a single, monolithic approach might miss. This allows for the creation of adaptive systems that can learn from their environment and interactions, enabling software to improve over time without constant manual intervention. MAS also open doors for powerful human-agent collaboration. They can function as intelligent assistants, providing developers with real-time insights, valuable code suggestions, and even taking on tedious debugging tasks, freeing up valuable developer time for higher-level creative problem-solving.\n\nMulti-Agent Systems represent more than just a technical advancement; they signify a paradigm shift in how we approach software development. By embracing this collaborative, intelligent, and decentralized methodology, developers can unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency, resilience, and innovation, ultimately building more robust and sophisticated software for the future.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"👏 Great job!

The future outlook involves deeper integration of AI, advancements in computing, and a growing emphasis on sustainable IT practices and robust cybersecurity measures.\nAggregatorAgent > ## Executive Summary: Converging Trends in Tech, Health, and Finance\n\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the undeniable common thread, driving transformative advancements across technology, health, and finance. In 2025, generative AI will revolutionize content creation, while explainable AI (XAI) becomes crucial for ethical implementation and regulatory compliance, particularly in sensitive sectors like healthcare and finance. AI-powered automation, enhanced by edge computing, promises increased efficiency and real-time applications.\n\n**Health** is experiencing a dual revolution: groundbreaking gene therapies and 3D bioprinting offer new hope for treating genetic and organ-related diseases, while AI is enhancing diagnostics, personalized treatments, and telemedicine for greater accessibility. The widespread availability of at-home COVID-19 and flu tests by late 2025 signifies a shift towards more proactive personal health management.\n\n**Finance** is rapidly evolving with embedded finance and AI-driven FinTech solutions. AI is personalizing financial services from budgeting to fraud detection, and while decentralized finance (DeFi) matures, stablecoins and pay-by-bank services gain traction. **Cybersecurity** emerges as a critical, cross-sector concern, with heightened investment in protecting sensitive data across all industries due to increasingly sophisticated threats, often amplified by AI.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n*   **AI Integration:** AI is no longer a standalone technology but a foundational driver across all sectors.\n*   **Personalization:** Expect increasingly personalized experiences in health, finance, and technology.\n*   **Ethical & Security Imperatives:** Transparency (XAI) and robust cybersecurity are paramount for trust and adoption.\n*   **Convergence:** Advancements in one sector often enable breakthroughs in others, creating a dynamic ecosystem of innovation.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":18},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"🎉 Great! You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-14T05:23:05.596808Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-14T05:23:05.597118Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-14T05:23:05.603788Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-14T05:23:05.597096Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-14T05:23:05.602463Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

Here are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Deepen Silas's character:** While we know Silas is a solitary, fifty-year veteran lighthouse keeper, giving him a brief internal thought or reaction about his life's routine or a hint of longing might make the discovery more impactful. For example, does he feel bored? Is he content? Does he ever wonder if there's more? This would add a layer of personal stake to the extraordinary find.\n\n2.  **Enhance the description of the map:** The \"strange, pliable material that shimmered\" and \"glowing with an ethereal, blue light\" are good starting points. Consider adding a tactile or even olfactory detail if appropriate, or a more vivid comparison for the \"swirling vortex of stars\" and \"radiant point.\" This could make the object feel even more alien and wondrous.\n\n3.  **Hint at the implications of the map:** The ending effectively creates intrigue, but you could add a subtle suggestion of what this map *might* represent. Is it a map to another world? A prophecy? A key? Even a brief internal question from Silas like, \"What star could this be?\" or \"Where does this path lead?\" could broaden the reader's anticipation.\nRefinerAgent > The salt spray kissed Silas’s grizzled beard as he trimmed the wick of the great lamp, the rhythmic sweep of its beam a solitary dance against the encroaching dark. For fifty years, this tower had been his universe, each creak of the aged wood, each mournful cry of the gulls, a familiar, almost monotonous, rhythm. He’d grown content in its predictable embrace, though sometimes, in the quietest hours before dawn, a flicker of a forgotten yearning for something *more* would stir within him, a ghost of the young man who’d first sought solace by the sea. Tonight, however, was different. While polishing the brass of the lantern room, his worn cloth snagged on a loose floorboard. A shiver traced its way down his spine, not of cold, but of sudden, inexplicable intrigue. Beneath it, nestled in a velvet-lined cavity that seemed to absorb the lamplight, lay a rolled parchment.\n\nWith hands roughened by decades of rope and salt, Silas unfurled it. He gasped, the sound swallowed by the wind’s howl.

Intricate lines, glowing with an ethereal, blue light, pulsed across its surface like veins of liquid starlight. It formed a map, but one unlike any Silas had ever seen in his fifty years of charting seas. It depicted no known coastlines, no familiar constellations. Instead, it showed a cosmic nebula, a swirling, opalescent vortex of stars that seemed to writhe with silent energy, with a single, impossibly radiant point at its heart, pulsing like a captured sun. Silas’s own heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic counterpoint to the steady thrum of the lamp above. The sea had always held its secrets, ancient and deep, but this… this was a secret of the cosmos itself. He traced the glowing lines, his mind reeling. \"What star could this be?\" he whispered, the words catching in his throat. \"And where does this path lead?\" The familiar rhythm of his world had shattered, replaced by the silent, luminous promise of the unknown.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
