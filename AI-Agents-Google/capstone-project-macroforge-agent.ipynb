It features a high-quality protein source from salmon, complex carbohydrates from quinoa, and healthy fats to aid in nutrient absorption and hormone production.\n","\n","**INGREDIENTS:**\n","\n","*   225g Salmon fillet\n","*   15g Olive oil\n","*   15g Butter\n","*   3 cloves Garlic, minced\n","*   1g Red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)\n","*   15ml Lemon juice\n","*   200g Asparagus, trimmed\n","*   100g Quinoa, dry\n","*   200ml Water or vegetable broth\n","*   Salt, to taste\n","*   Black pepper, to taste\n","\n","**INSTRUCTIONS:**\n","\n","1.  **Prepare Quinoa:** Rinse the quinoa thoroughly under cold water. In a small saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa with water or vegetable broth, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy.\n","2.  **Prepare Asparagus:** Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F). Toss the trimmed asparagus with 5g of olive oil, salt, and pepper on a baking sheet. Roast for 10-12 minutes, or until tender-crisp.\n","3.  **Prepare Salmon:** While the asparagus roasts, pat the salmon fillet dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining 10g of olive oil and 5g of butter in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter is melted and shimmering, add the salmon, skin-side down (if applicable). Sear for 3-4 minutes until the skin is crispy.\n","4.  **Make Garlic Butter Sauce:** Flip the salmon. Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes to the skillet. Cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant, being careful not to burn the garlic. Add the remaining 10g of butter and the lemon juice. As the butter melts, spoon the garlic butter sauce over the salmon.\n","5.  **Finish Salmon:** Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for another 5-7 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.\n","6.  **Assemble:** Fluff the cooked quinoa with a fork. Serve the salmon alongside the roasted asparagus and a portion of quinoa. Drizzle any remaining garlic butter sauce from the skillet over the salmon and quinoa.\n","\n","**NUTRITION (per serving):**\n","\n","*   Calories: 795 kcal\n","*   Protein: 61g\n","*   Carbs: 51g\n","*   Fat: 45g\n","\n","Would you like me to calculate the macros for this recipe to verify them, or would you like to explore substitutions or create a shopping list?\n","\n","\n","======================================================================\n","Query 2/4: Calculate the macros for this recipe\n","======================================================================\n","\n","\n","### Session: interative-session\n","\n","User > Calculate the macros for this recipe\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.

Lean Ground Beef (90% lean / 10% fat)**\n","*   **Ratio:** Use 225g of ground beef.\n","*   **Impact:** This will significantly change the dish's texture from flaky salmon to crumbly beef. The flavor will shift from oceanic to savory. You'd likely need to brown the beef separately and adjust how it's incorporated. The garlic butter sauce will also pair differently.\n","*   **Nutrition:** Approx. 450-500 kcal, 45-50g protein, 0g carbs, 25-30g fat.\n","*   **Bodybuilding Rating:** Similar protein, but higher in saturated fat.\n","\n","**2. Extra Lean Ground Beef (93% lean / 7% fat)**\n","*   **Ratio:** Use 225g of ground beef.\n","*   **Impact:** Similar to lean ground beef, but with a slightly leaner profile. Browning separately is still recommended.\n","*   **Nutrition:** Approx. 420-470 kcal, 46-52g protein, 0g carbs, 20-25g fat.\n","*   **Bodybuilding Rating:** Closer to salmon in fat content than 90% lean.\n","\n","**3. Ground Turkey (93% lean / 7% fat)**\n","*   **Ratio:** Use 225g of ground turkey.\n","*   **Impact:** Offers a lighter flavor and more tender texture than ground beef, making it a somewhat better substitute for salmon's texture. Browning separately is advised.\n","*   **Nutrition:** Approx. 360-400 kcal, 48-54g protein, 0g carbs, 15-20g fat.\n","*   **Bodybuilding Rating:** A good alternative, closer to salmon in fat profile.\n","\n","**4. Ground Chicken Breast (very lean)**\n","*   **Ratio:** Use 225g of ground chicken breast.\n","*   **Impact:** This is the leanest option with a very mild flavor and crumbly texture. It will absorb flavors well.\n","*   **Nutrition:** Approx. 300-330 kcal, 50-56g protein, 0g carbs, 5-8g fat.\n","*   **Bodybuilding Rating:** Excellent lean protein source with a high protein-to-calorie ratio.\n","\n","Would you like me to adjust the recipe with one of these substitutions, or do you have something else in mind?\n","\n","\n","======================================================================\n","Query 4/4: Go with 90% lean ground beef and create a shopping list for 2 servings\n","======================================================================\n","\n","\n","### Session: interative-session\n","\n","User > Go with 90% lean ground beef and create a shopping list for 2 servings\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
