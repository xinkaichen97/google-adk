The flavor will be richer and more distinctly beefy.\n","Nutrition: Similar protein content, but potentially slightly higher in fat and calories depending on the leanness. 90% lean ground beef typically contains around 20-22g of protein per 100g, making 150g about 30-33g of protein. This is comparable to chicken thigh.\n","Bodybuilding Rating: Similar\n","\n","SUBSTITUTION 2:\n","Ingredient: Beef Sirloin Steak (trimmed of visible fat)\n","Ratio: 1:1 (Use 150g of beef sirloin steak)\n","Impact: This will provide a more classic steak texture. Ensure it's cooked to your desired doneness. The flavor will be a robust beef taste.\n","Nutrition: Very similar protein content to chicken thigh, often slightly higher per 100g for lean cuts like sirloin. Expect around 25-30g of protein per 100g, so 150g would be approximately 37-45g of protein. It will be leaner than chicken thigh.\n","Bodybuilding Rating: Better\n","\n","SUBSTITUTION 3:\n","Ingredient: Beef Tenderloin (trimmed of visible fat)\n","Ratio: 1:1 (Use 150g of beef tenderloin)\n","Impact: Tenderloin is very tender and has a milder beef flavor compared to sirloin. It will cook quickly and offer a luxurious texture.\n","Nutrition: High in protein and generally leaner than chicken thigh. Similar to sirloin, expect around 25-30g of protein per 100g, yielding 37-45g of protein from 150g.\n","Bodybuilding Rating: Better\n","\n","SUBSTITUTION 4:\n","Ingredient: Beef Chuck Roast (leaner cuts, trimmed)\n","Ratio: 1:1 (Use 150g of beef chuck roast, trimmed)\n","Impact: Chuck roast is typically used for slower cooking methods. If pan-frying or stir-frying, it will require a tenderizing marinade or cooking technique to avoid toughness. Flavor is rich beef.\n","Nutrition: Can be fattier than chicken thigh if not trimmed well, but lean cuts will offer good protein.
